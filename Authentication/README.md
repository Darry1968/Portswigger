## Authentication vulnerabilities 

Authentication vulnerabilities can allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data and functionality. They also expose additional attack surface for further exploits.

**How do authentication vulnerabilities arise?**

Most vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms occur in one of two ways:

1. The authentication mechanisms are weak because they fail to adequately protect against brute-force attacks.
2. Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation allow the authentication mechanisms to be bypassed entirely by an attacker. This is sometimes called "broken authentication".
